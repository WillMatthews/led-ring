# LED Ring Board

This board is designed to place a ring of LEDs around a 30mm cage system.
Power it through a SMA connector, and place whatever 3mm LEDs you want on the board.
Choice of resistors is up to you, but I recommend you choose a good operating point (see datasheets, and compare with your power supply).

## Board
The board is a torus.

## Mount
A 3D printed mount is provided to attach the board to a 30mm cage system.
